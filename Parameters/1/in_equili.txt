Steady State (Equilibrium) Input File determining the underlying Steady State
FORMAT:

k ell L0 kappa
drst

where
k is polytropic exponent
	choosing k < 0 gives the King model (in this case we ignore ell and L0)
ell is other polytropic exponent
L0 is lower bound on L-values
kappa is steady state parameter
	choosing kappa < 0 means that kappa is chosen s.t. Rmax=1 (in cases where the Eddington-Ritter relation applies)
drst is radial step size used for the steady state construction
