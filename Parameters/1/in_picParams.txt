PIC Parameter Input File, in FORMAT

T
dtoverdr
am_tplots Nrplot am_trajparts with_chess
partsout
fname

where
T is final time
dtoverdr determines time step size of PIC as ratio dt/dr , where dr is radial step size of initialisation
am_tplots gives number of time steps at which we write output files for macroscopic functions & particles 
Nrplot gives number of radial steps at which we evaluate the radial functions for the output files
am_trajparts gives number of particles whose positions we track
with_chess determines whether we create plots for |\rho(t_1)-\rho(t_2)| etc (1) or not (0)
partsout determines whether we output positions of all particles (1) or not (0) so that we can continue the calculation later
fname is (suffix of) filename for all output files
