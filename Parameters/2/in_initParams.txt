Initialisation Parameter Input File, in FORMAT

dr usteps asteps
min_parts_mio
fromFile

where
dr is radial step size used for initialisation
usteps is (maximal) amount of u-steps used for initialisation at each fixed radius
asteps is amount of alpha-steps used for initialisation at each fixed (r,u)-pair
min_parts_mio gives minimal amount of particles in millions we use;
	increase usteps and asteps to achieve this number
fromFile determines whether we read in entire particles from particle file
	0 means that particles are created in this very simulations, 1 means that we are reading them from a particle file
